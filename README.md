# Treasury

Certain portions of ESN distributed to development organizations can be spent for community proposals.

# Proposals

Any member of the community can create a funding proposal. A community member can propose any activity that contributes to the improvement of the Ethersocial project. The proposal creator can himself implement this proposal and receive a payment for it, or leave the proposal open so that other community members can work on it and receive a reward.

# Proposal labels

- `assigned` -  the one who implements the proposal will receive the reward.
- `in-progress` - the implementation of this proposal is already started.
